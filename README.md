Answers:
Data Structures I Used
- ArrayList, for guests and venues. Easy to add/remove and loop through.
- Queue, for tasks that need to be done in order.
- Stack, for undoing tasks (last thing done = first thing undone).
- HashMap, for the seating chart (table number → list of guests).
  Searching & Sorting
- I used linear search whenever I needed to find something (like a guest or a venue).
- I didn’t need any sorting for this project.
  Big‑O Complexity
- Finding a guest: O(n) because I scan through the list.
- Selecting a venue: O(n) for the same reason.
- Generating seating: O(n) since I loop through all guests once.
